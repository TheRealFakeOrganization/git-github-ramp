## :running: Activities

Follow along with the activities below to walk through the process of creating a feature branch and creating a Pull Request to merge your changes into the fork (origin) repository.

### 1 - Create a Feature Branch

__All Team Members__

Choose a writer &mdash; you will add their song to the project within a new feature branch. If there are more writers than people, that is fine, only one feature branch will ultimately be merged.

Create a feature branch off of the `develop` branch that contains the writer's name and the month of the pick:
```sh
$ git checkout develop

$ git checkout -b feature/arctic_monkeys

$ git branch
* feature/arctic_monkeys
  develop
  main
```

:bulb: Feature branches will be named such that someone else can look at what branches are in progress and get a rough idea of what work is being done on each branch.

:bulb: You can create a branch without immediately checking out the branch via the `git branch` command:
```sh
$ git branch feature/arctic_monkeys
```

### 2 - Make Changes to the Project

__All Team Members__

In your text editor, make the following changes:

1. Add the new song under the [`/app/song/feb/`](/app/song/feb/) directory.
2. Update the writer's page in the [`/app/writer/`](/app/writer/) directory.
3. Update the main mage [`/app/index.md`](/app/index.md).

Since other people are going to be making changes at the same time, be careful not to make changes to lines of code that are not relevant to your change.

### 3 - Review Changes

__All Team Members__

If you view the current git status, you will see 2 files with unstaged changes and a new folder that has not been tracked by git:
```sh
$ git status
On branch feature/arctic_monkeys
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   app/index.md
        modified:   app/writer/arctic_monkeys.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        app/song/feb/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

If you run a diff, you should see the changes that have been made to files that are tracked by git:
```sh
$ git diff
diff --git a/app/index.md b/app/index.md
index ac3abad..9777cd5 100644

### 4 - Stage and Commit Changes

Stage all of the changes that you've made thus far:
```sh
$ git add app/*
# Careful, using a wildcard adds any file that has changed that matches the pattern.

$ git status
On branch feature/arctic_monkeys
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   app/index.md
        new file:   app/song/feb/r_u_mine.md
        modified:   app/writer/arctic_monkeys.md
```

:bulb: If you run a diff now, you will not see any changes. This is because `git diff` compares all staged changes to unstaged changes.

:bulb: You may find that the process of viewing diffs, staging files, and making commits is easier in GitHub Desktop

Now that all of your changes have been staged, commit them with an appropriate message:
```sh
$ git commit -m "Adding R U Mine? Feb Song"
```

### 5 - Push Changes to Fork

Now that your changes have been committed, let's get them published to your Fork on GitHub:
```sh
$ git push -u origin HEAD
```

:bulb: Specifying the HEAD reference instructs git to push to the same branch as the HEAD of your local project, which is currently your feature branch.

:bulb: The `-u` flag instructs git to link your local branch with the remote's branch so that future push & pull commands do not require you
to specify where you would like to push or pull code from.

Navigate to your Fork on Github, you should now see your new branch in the interface.

### 6 - Open a Pull Request

On your GitHub fork, you should see a block at the top indicating that you've recently pushed a branch. If this is visible, click the "Compare & Pull Request" button to the right of your feature branch. If it is not available, choose your branch in the dropdown just above the code directory listing and then click the "New Pull Request" button to the right of the dropdown.

On the Pull Request interface, make sure make sure to click "compare across forks" and the base fork is `source-username\repository-name` and the base branch is `develop`. This means that you are requesting to merge your changes into the `develop` branch of the source repository. At this time also make sure that the head fork and compare branches match your GitHub Fork and feature branch, respectively.

Please draft a message documenting the changes that you've made and then click the green "Create pull request" button.

## Next

Next we will walk through the process of reviewing a Pull Request, viewing someone else's code locally, and merging a Pull Request.
