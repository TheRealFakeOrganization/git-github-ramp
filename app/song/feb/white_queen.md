## Songfacts
1. Subtitled "As It Began," this song was written by Queen guitarist Brian May. It has a medieval, mystical feel, telling the story of a journey to see the White Queen. In the end, there is sorrow, as the journey ends as it began.
2. It's possible the song is an allegory for real-life relationship, but more likely it's storytelling, which delivered in the voice of Freddie Mercury proved transformative.
3. The album also contains a song called "The March Of The Black Queen," which was written by Freddie Mercury. The songs don't seem related, but if you're looking for a concept, you can see them as tug between good and evil.
4. This was a concert favorite for Queen, performed at many of their shows in the '70s. It was never a hit, but went over very well live and helped the band pace the show. Mercury set at the piano for much of the song, giving him some time off his feet.
5. Queen was still working their way up when they released the Queen II album with the iconic cover photo of the band peering out of the darkness. It was the work of photographer Mick Rock, who was the lensman to the glam and avant-garde, having worked with Lou Reed, David Bowie and Iggy Pop. 6. Queen were keen to work with him, but Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon were a little concerned that the photo would come off as pretentious. According to Rock, Freddie Mercury had no qualms, telling his bandmates they had every right to be pretentious because they were that good.
