Album: Double fantasy

## SongFacts

1) This is a track from Double Fantasy, Lennon's final album during his lifetime, released only three weeks before his murder. The song resulted from John's inability to get Yoko on the phone at a time when he feared for their relationship.
2) Yoko Ono told Q November 2010 that this is one of her favorite Lennon songs. She said: "I'm Losing You is an incredible song. I think as a songwriter, that tops it all. Some of the songs I'm in. But it's almost like Picasso drawing a lot of his wife because his wife was around. And I was very lucky I was his wife."
3) Co-producer Tom Douglas brought Rick Nielsen and Bun E. Carlos of the band Cheap Trick to play on this song, but it was eventually re-recorded with the studio musicians. The Cheap Trick version was included on the John Lennon Anthology collection released in 1998.
4) Director Jay Dubin, whose work at the time included commercials for Crazy Eddie's, was called in to shoot a music video to promote the Double Fantasy album. On August 10, 1980, he brought his team to the Hit Factory studio and captured Lennon performing this song, along with "I'm Moving On" and some cover tunes. The video was abandoned after Lennon's death a few months later and the footage has never materialized.
